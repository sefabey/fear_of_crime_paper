# Intro

A quick markdown file to search London gang slang on Twitter. 


Rationale: 


Involves:
    1. Data scraping from multiple sources (one html one pdf)
    2. Data wrangling (duh)
    3. Querying from Twitter search API
    4. Memoise API call

Sources:    https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/14817/1/FulltextThesis.pdf

https://www.shinobilifeonline.com/index.php?topic=2973.0
    
# 1. Data Scraping

##Srape keywords from a web page using Rvest

Scaping data from: https://www.shinobilifeonline.com/index.php?topic=2973.0. Used selectorgadget to identify xpath. This code scrapes all ters in the web page and returns a list consisting of **120** slang terms.


```r
html01 <- "https://www.shinobilifeonline.com/index.php?topic=2973.0"


slangs <- rvest::html(html01) %>% 
    rvest::html_nodes( xpath = '//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "inner", " " ))]//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "bbc_size", " " ))]') %>% 
    rvest::html_text() %>% 
    as.tibble() %>% 
    mutate(slang_term=value) %>% 
    mutate(letter_count=str_count(slang_term)) %>% 
    filter(letter_count>1) %>% 
    # mutate(double_words= case_when( str_detect(slang_term, "/") ~ "yes",TRUE ~ "no")) %>% #no need to do this, separate_rows works as expected
    separate_rows(slang_term, sep = "/") %>% 
    distinct(slang_term,.keep_all = T) %>% 
    filter(!row_number()==1) %>% #drop the first row which was a header 
    mutate(slang_term_lower= str_to_lower(slang_term)) %>% 
    select(slang_term,slang_term_lower)

slangs <- slangs %>% 
    mutate(slang_term_query= paste0('\"',slangs$slang_term_lower,'\"'))

# wrote this slangs data to file just in case
```

##Scrape tweets using rtweet

Using SEARCH API, I queried 50 tweets for each term in the slang list. Apparently, not every slang term returned 50 tweets (some are really obscure and uncommon terms/spellings). Ultimately, this query resulted in a dataframe consisting of 5604 rows.


I am using below chunk for ~~memoising and/or caching purposes~~ future reference only. I wrote query results to a csv file and I will be working with that (otherwise I need to query twitter API everytime I knit the rmd. This is impractical as it 1) returns different results each time, (2) twitter rate limits are pain). Therefore, not evaluating below chunk at all. 



```r
slangs <- slangs %>% 
    mutate(slang_term_query= paste0('\"',slangs$slang_term_lower,'\"'))

slang_tweets <- purrr::map_df(.x = slangs$slang_term_query, .f =  rtweet::search_tweets, 
                              n = 50, include_rts=F)

rate_limit() %>% 
    arrange(reset)

slang_tweets %>% rtweet::write_as_csv("slang_tweets.csv")
```


read slang tweets from csv

```r
slang_tweets <- rtweet::read_twitter_csv("../data/slang_tweets.csv")
```


# 2. Exploring Tweets Matching keywords from Slangs list

Below, I will define and use a function that (1)finds tweets (scraped previously) which match nth term from the slangs list, (2) randomly sample 20 tweets matching nth term, (3) print tweet text.

Then, I will read these tweets and try to get a sense of what they refer to. I will print the tweets first and then add my comments


```r
print_slang_tweets <- function(n) {
    slang_tweets %>% 
        select(text) %>% 
        filter(str_detect(slang_tweets$text, pattern = regex (slangs$slang_term_lower[n],ignore_case = T))) %>% 
        distinct(text) %>% 
        sample_n(20, replace = T) %>% 
        distinct(text)
        }    
```

**Comments:** term used to query twitter api was **Harlem Spartans**. Observed refences to a UK band called Harlem Spartans. HS are apparently banned for references to violence an uk gang culture in their music. Some references to violence (see the 3rd tweet for instance). Maybe useful for studying further.

### 5) Term: **Ounto Nation**
